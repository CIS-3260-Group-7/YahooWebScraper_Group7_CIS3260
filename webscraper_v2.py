numpy: makes array operations simple and fast

pandas: helps convert the data in a tabular structure, and can 
        manipulate the data with numerous functions that have been
        efficiently developed

urllib3: HTTP client for Python

certifi: provides Mozillaâ€™s carefully curated collection of 
        Root Certificates for validating the trustworthiness clear
        
        of SSL certificates while verifying the identity of 
        TLS hosts.

BeautifulSoup: This library helps to get the HTML structure 
                of the page that is to be manipulated.

Save HTML response in content variable

Use BeautifulSoup's built in find_all() function to target all table HTML tags and iterate through
all the tables on the page and print HTML structure.

content = getHTMLContent(link)
tables = content.find_all('table')
for table in tables:
    print(table.prettify())
